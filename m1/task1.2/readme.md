The result of done a Task 1.2 Module 1 is an html page with colour style and some images. 
These are published on GitHub repository in a Master branch. It consists of next branches:
- DEVELOP - a branch with index.html file.
- STYLES - a branch with style.css file.
- IMAGES - a branch with images folder.
The Styles and Images branches were created separately, after that merged with Develop branch.
But because we have some changes in the index.html (Develop branch) before creating Images and Styles,
there is some conflict happened during merge. So it was solved manually successful in text editor, commited and pushed into GitHub origin.
